## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Understand Airbnb listing characteristics, pricing distributions, and guest ratings.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Visualize listings based on location, availability, and price.
- **Price Prediction**: Leverage machine learning models to predict optimal pricing for Airbnb properties.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Use Streamlit to visualize key insights and metrics for Airbnb data.
- **Actionable Insights**: Discover trends that can help Airbnb hosts optimize their listing strategies.
